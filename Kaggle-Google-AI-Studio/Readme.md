## Why?

IEEE Humanitarian Technologies (IEEE HT) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) are harnessing generative AI to reduce the burden of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in The Gambia through a scalable, inclusive, and localized chatbot solution in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), the Be He@lthy, Be Mobile initiative and the UN Inter-Agency Task Force on NCDs.

[Impact] NCDs are the leading cause of premature death in The Gambia. Nearly half of all adults live with hypertension, and one in five has multiple risk factors. Without new approaches, the burden will continue to grow—straining families and overwhelming health systems. According to the WHO and ITU, chatbot-based interventions could save more than 400,000 lives globally in the next decade.

## What?

Chatbot: Community Health Workers (CHW) Hypertension Mentor built in Google AI Studio by using only prompts. Chatbot is intended for Community Health Workers in described Use Cases.

## How?

- First, prompted to create a chatbot to provide hypertension knowledge for CH Workers.
- Next, I asked for a learning path, training via quiz and simulation.
- Next, (based on published Relevant Resources), restricted knowledge base to two documents.
- Next, I thought that these two documents may not be updated frequently, then prompted Google AI Studio to consider NIH publications when there is not enough information in the given documents. This should allow CH Workers to access the recent medical information about hypertension, prevention, and management (=> [constants.ts]() added secondary source into its prompt).
- Next, prompted to add a feature to record a patient's progress (=> Patient Records).
- Next, prompted to add translation of English text responses to one of the local languages spoken in Gambia.
- Next, prompted to update background colors.
- Next, prompted to add multiple patient profiles to Patient Simulator so that CHW will have opportunity to practice with different patient profiles.
- Finally, prompted to provide feedback to CH Worker after completing a patient simulator case so that CHW knows what was good, what needs to be improved, and what needs to be re-studied.

## Summary

- Considering the scope of GenAI For Good Challenge for Gambia, this chatbot addressed some of these use cases for one persona. However, the speed of building something useful is impressive.
- Although I just started utilizing Google AI Studio, I can easily predict how such tools will accelerate many steps in GenAI product development.
