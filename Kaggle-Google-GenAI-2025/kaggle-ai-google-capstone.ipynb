Agriculture employs nearly one-third of Lesotho’s workforce. But farmers and agricultural advisors face limited services, scarce digital tools, and mounting climate pressures. Without new solutions, **food security and rural resilience will remain at risk**. (see Geography and Climate in [Lesotho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesotho))\n\n**AI Farming Buddy** attempts to build a single pane of glass  with LLM Agent personalized recommendations for farmers.
