Agriculture employs nearly one-third of Lesotho’s workforce. But farmers and agricultural advisors face limited services, scarce digital tools, and mounting climate pressures. Without new solutions, **food security and rural resilience will remain at risk**.

Next, you must call 'get_fields_of_farmer_by_name()' by using farmer's name to find the fields of farmer, crop on each field, latitude and longitude of each field \n4. Next, you must call 'weather_agent' to get the local weather for the farmer's fields.\n5. Next, you must call 'rt_farming_measurements_agent' to collect farming measurements (such as accumulated GDD, Bligt Cast Severity Value) of the farmer's fields \n6. Next, you must call 'rt_farming_alerts_agent' to get alerts for each field growing the crop.\n7. Next, you must call to get recommendations for each field growing the crop.\n8.

Since the temperatures will be in the mid-70s, a light shirt or t-shirt would be comfortable.
